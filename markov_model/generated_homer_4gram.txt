Procedurally Generated Homer by Anja Beth

*************** Stanza1*************** 
None None Great Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate There fix'd
he stood before the golden wain, And bow'd to dust the honours of his
mane. None The same night continues; the scene lies in the field near
the monument of Ilus.




*************** Stanza2*************** 
Nor is it only in the main design that they have been put off with a
vile counterfeit got up at second hand. None None None The repetition
is not ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the
deceased, and the honour in which he was held.




*************** Stanza3*************** 
Beside each chief his azure armour lay, And round the lists the
admiring armies stand, With javelins fix'd, the Greek and Trojan band.
None None None None




*************** Stanza4*************** 
Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore; Be still yourselves, and
ye shall need no more. None At this the king his generous joy
express'd, And clasp'd the warrior to his throne; Sullen he sat, and
curb'd the rising groan. The maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,
Due to the deeds of many a dreadful day? None




*************** Stanza5*************** 
None None None None Still unresisted shall the foe destroy, And
stretch the slaughter to the fleet they spread, And fall by mutual
wounds around the dead.
